        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.

        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
        copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
        (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
        to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
        and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
        Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
        on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
        subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:

        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
            Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that You changed the files; and

        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
            that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
            excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
            the Derivative Works; and

        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
            distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
            include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
            within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
            pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
            of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
            as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
            documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
            within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
            wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
            of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
            do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
            notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
            or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
            that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
            as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

By downloading and/or using the Model & Software (including downloading, cloning, installing, and any other use of this github repository), you acknowledge that you have read these terms and conditions, understand them, and agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not download and/or use the Model & Software. Any infringement of the terms of this agreement will automatically terminate your rights under this License

    Ownership / Licensees
    The Software and the associated materials has been developed at the

    Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (hereinafter "MPI").

    Any copyright or patent right is owned by and proprietary material of the

    Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften e.V. (hereinafter “MPG”; MPI and MPG hereinafter collectively “Max-Planck”)

    hereinafter the “Licensor”.

    License Grant
    Licensor grants you (Licensee) personally a single-user, non-exclusive, non-transferable, free of charge right:

    To install the Model & Software on computers owned, leased or otherwise controlled by you and/or your organization;
    To use the Model & Software for the sole purpose of performing non-commercial scientific research, non-commercial education, or non-commercial artistic projects;
    Any other use, in particular any use for commercial, pornographic, military, or surveillance, purposes is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, incorporation in a commercial product, use in a commercial service, or production of other artifacts for commercial purposes. The Data & Software may not be used to create fake, libelous, misleading, or defamatory content of any kind excluding analyses in peer-reviewed scientific research. The Data & Software may not be reproduced, modified and/or made available in any form to any third party without Max-Planck’s prior written permission.

    The Data & Software may not be used for pornographic purposes or to generate pornographic material whether commercial or not. This license also prohibits the use of the Software to train methods/algorithms/neural networks/etc. for commercial, pornographic, military, surveillance, or defamatory use of any kind. By downloading the Data & Software, you agree not to reverse engineer it.

    No Distribution
    The Model & Software and the license herein granted shall not be copied, shared, distributed, re-sold, offered for re-sale, transferred or sub-licensed in whole or in part except that you may make one copy for archive purposes only.

    Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties
    You expressly acknowledge and agree that the Model & Software results from basic research, is provided “AS IS”, may contain errors, and that any use of the Model & Software is at your sole risk. LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MODEL & SOFTWARE, NEITHER EXPRESS NOR IMPLIED, AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY LEGAL OR ACTUAL DEFECTS, WHETHER DISCOVERABLE OR NOT.

    Limitation of Liability
    Because this Model & Software License Agreement qualifies as a donation, according to Section 521 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch – BGB) Licensor as a donor is liable for intent and gross negligence only. If the Licensor fraudulently conceals a legal or material defect, they are obliged to compensate the Licensee for the resulting damage.
    Licensor shall be liable for loss of data only up to the amount of typical recovery costs which would have arisen had proper and regular data backup measures been taken. For the avoidance of doubt Licensor shall be liable in accordance with the German Product Liability Act in the event of product liability. The foregoing applies also to Licensor’s legal representatives or assistants in performance. Any further liability shall be excluded.
    Patent claims generated through the usage of the Model & Software cannot be directed towards the copyright holders.
    The Model & Software is provided in the state of development the licensor defines. If modified or extended by Licensee, the Licensor makes no claims about the fitness of the Model & Software and is not responsible for any problems such modifications cause.

    No Maintenance Services
    You understand and agree that Licensor is under no obligation to provide either maintenance services, update services, notices of latent defects, or corrections of defects with regard to the Model & Software. Licensor nevertheless reserves the right to update, modify, or discontinue the Model & Software at any time.

    Defects of the Model & Software must be notified in writing to the Licensor with a comprehensible description of the error symptoms. The notification of the defect should enable the reproduction of the error. The Licensee is encouraged to communicate any use, results, modification or publication.
